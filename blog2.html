        <h1>How was the last 10 days with NEOGCAMP in level0?</h1>
        <h3>Know about NEOGCAMP from someone at 14-09-2021 , at night then I search about here and there , I feel this bootcamp can be life-changing for me ,so I tight my seat belt</h3>
        <h2>First Day-15/09/2021</h2>
        <p>First day is the scary I never do javascript .But making own app is intresting ,learn about many stuff that day about javascript and how to  call a function,I just try my best how to do it.App like Do you know me and Marvel-Quiz . Sharing each and other the stuff.Makin own CLI app.</p>
        <h2>16-09-2021</h2>
        <p>In this vedio Tanay only told about the basic things , but I learn about how to use Github Desktop and how It make it easier rather than doing with command typing it all this stuff make it difficult , learn about many shortcut keys in VSCOSE editor and also learn about how to write a good commit </p>
        <h2>17-09-2021</h2>
        <p>I know about CSS and HTML , but I learn about lot of new things in these two vedios and make my own portfolio, which was time taking ,I learn lot about designing how image can make it good.How Tanay helps in each vedio is just aamzing </p>
        <h2>18-09-2021</h2>
        <p>I heard about VANILLAJS , Tanay also share about views why you should know VANILLAJS giving super helpful insights from insides.This were I feel it is like roller coster up and down , after seeing vedio I couldn't know what happen,and then notes which I made from vedio try my own it is like magic starting getting logic how It happen,I have tried my own. Remember how Tanay explain each and everything about minion  translation is fun and also make other app in elvish language</p>
        <h2>19-09-2021</h2>
        <p> This is first with react, It feels like what is happening I couldn't figure out it is last vedio for the level zero in the for 2021 NEOGCAMP batch , but not for me it is overwhelmed for me as Tanay said again and again but I try my best do it my own one app is made in vedio , but understanding react take time I tried with my notes best if I could not get I go through demo code and vedio again and react assignment takes lot of time , second one I have no approach so I go through demo code. </p>
        <h2>20-09-2021</h2>
        <p>This vedio is different from others ,In this vedio Tanay didn't teach it is cash register app , made by NEOGRAMMER ROHIT so,it is made by his student, it is intresting from see how his student make their own my confidence from this vedio start increasing , I also added one more practice after writing code with help I delete whole code again, retry own my own in this I also try bonus in this section take long time
        </p>
        <h2>21-09-2021</h2>
        <p>In this learn about how to make the app is birthday lucky or not but it makes with help of Kanishk Bhaiya,This vedio is fun and it learn about many more thing there community .</p>
        <h3>22-09-2021</h3>
        <p>In this from Sruthi ,she is amazing teacher explain each and everything wonderfullly.In this vedio learn about form it I also try my own which is different from vedio ,my confidence increasing in VANILLAJS </p>
        <h3>23-09-2021</h3>
        <p>Birthday Palindrome is the vedio which make me sense how much coding can be logical , Kushank teaches it really amazing from each and each vedio my mind get to know how to see I erases my code multiple times. Most frustrating part after learning is this I also try for previous day but it didn't work so after this code destructure my code next day taking one variable is array for ctr and next date I have to break down the code in two parts.  </p>
        <h3>24-09-2021</h3>
        <p>Stock app it is the app i feel everything changed I have confidence , Tanay sir is the person who motivates a  lot in the whole processes it also tell what should be attitude for getting this.I learned a lot from these people it is the experience whcih i would nevr forget I also make very silly mistake.</p>
